# AI-accelerators
This captures the experience gained working on NPU, TPU and GPU. A.s part of the Faculty Development Program, Theory and Demos session on practical aspects of AI accelerators were delivered.https://www.dataeverconsulting.com/news FDP schedule is given here.https://www.dataeverconsulting.com/_files/ugd/9df56a_a05d6afae53b4165a39f59514be4cbab.pdf

# What is an AI accelerator ?
An artificial intelligence (AI) accelerator, also known as an AI chip, deep learning processor or neural processing unit (NPU), is a hardware accelerator that is built to speed AI neural networks, deep learning and machine learning. 

# NPU
In order to give practical demos to the participants, we have installed a Khadas Vim3 Pro Single Board Computer(SBC). This has a NPU
