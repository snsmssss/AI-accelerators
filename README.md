# AI-accelerators
This captures the experience gained working on NPU, TPU and GPU. As part of the Faculty Development Program, a theory and Demo. session on practical aspects of AI accelerators were delivered.https://www.dataeverconsulting.com/news FDP schedule is given here.https://www.dataeverconsulting.com/_files/ugd/9df56a_a05d6afae53b4165a39f59514be4cbab.pdf

# What is an AI accelerator ?
An artificial intelligence (AI) accelerator, also known as an AI chip, deep learning processor or neural processing unit (NPU), is a hardware accelerator that is built to speed AI neural networks, deep learning and machine learning. 

#How do you benchmark AI accelerator? Any performance metrics?

# NPU
In order to give practical demos to the participants, we had installed a Khadas Vim3 Pro Single Board Computer(SBC). This has a NPU as shown below

To install Khadas Software for Neural Net(KSNN), We followed this youtube video. You may find it handy as well.- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaGBdhAZqTM

# TPU
Google offered me 30 days credit for using TPU POD. This helped me to demonstrate this to attendees of the Faculty Development Program.

Google documentation is excellent. It answers all your questions. We found it to be very useful.
